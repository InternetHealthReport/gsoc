# Instructions for mentors

## Ideas
If you're an IHR contributor, and you wish to participate in Google Summer of Code, make a proposal in the [ideas page](ideas.md), based what your project needs.

If you wish to mentor, please read the [instructions common to all participants](README.md) and the [Summer of Code FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#general).

Your idea proposal should be a brief description of what the project is, what the desired goals would be, what the student/developer should know and an email address for contact.
Students are not required to follow your idea to the letter, so regard your proposal as inspiration for the students.

## Mentoring
Any IHR contributor can be a mentor if you meet the GSoC eligibility requirements. 
Possibly the student has never worked on such a large project and will need some help. 
Make sure you're up for the task.
Mentoring takes time, and lots and lots of communication.

Know that we will never assign you to a project you do not want to work on. 
We will not assign you more projects than you can/want to take on either.
And you will have a backup mentor, just in case something unforeseen takes place.

## Signing up as a mentor
1) Contact one of the admins (Romain or Emile) and give your google-connected account email
2) Add your proposal in the [ideas page](ideas.md)
3) Log in to [GSoC webapp](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) after being added as a mentor by one of the admins
