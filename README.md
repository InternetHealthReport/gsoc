# IHR / Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

> [!NOTE]
> **We discourage the use of AI tools in communications and contributions.** The goal of GSoC is for you to learn and improve your skills, not just to finish your project at any cost. However, if you do use any AI or LLMs, you must disclose their use in your PRs and/or conversations with your mentor. Additionally, you must fully understand and be able to explain any AI-generated code you submit. **Any undisclosed use of AI** or Large Language Models, or inability to explain AI-generated contributions, **will be grounds for instant disqualification**.

## Tips for Proposal ðŸš€ 
Writing the proposal is difficult. Understanding what to write, how much to include and what to exclude is a difficult decision. We have curated a template which we highly **encourage** you to follow, since it will be easier for you to write and for us to review. Use this **[template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSLQp7SLrREZ78lMCiMDv6iaevH-FqkCg1u2OpVDU3Q/edit?usp=sharing)**.

Make sure to create a copy of the template. The file should follow this naming format: `{firstname}_{lastname}_{project}.pdf`, where:
- `{firstname}` should be replaced with your first name
- `{lastname}` should be replaced with your last name
- `{project}` should be replaced with the project's title or idea

To view some selected proposals from previous years, check out the `proposals` directory.
